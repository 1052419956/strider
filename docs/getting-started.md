# Getting Started

By following the instructions below you can get Strider setup on your local machine.


## Assumptions

- You have all of your [required dependencies](requirements.md) installed.
- You have mongodb running locally on the default ports.
- Port `3000` is exposed to the internet.
- You have your public IP ready to be used.


## Installation

Use `npm` to install Strider as a global npm module.

```sh
npm install -g strider
```

This will give you access to the `strider` command, which we will use to start Strider
in a bit.
